- 👋 Hi, I’m @mpmcgrellis
- 👀 I’m interested in making computers do things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning microcontrollers
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything (but probably won't have time 🙁 )
- 📫 Just lurking right now

If my stats look sad, it's because most of my work is in private repos.  See my the profile of my alter-ego [mmcgrellis-cyracom](https://github.com/mmcgrellis-cyracom) for a better idea of how busy i've been.
